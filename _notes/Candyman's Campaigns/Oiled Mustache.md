In a stunning display of valor and determination, the valiant soldiers of 207 delivered a crushing blow to Ion Corp's operations in the region during the fourth mission of Operation Oiled Mustache. Spearheaded by Reaper Assault, the armored units of Ion Corp found their fuel reserves drained by the strategic maneuvers of 207 forces. Meanwhile, Alpha and Bravo squads engaged in fierce urban combat, bravely fighting street-to-street to liberate the city from Ion Corp's oppressive grip. Despite the enemy's ruthless tactics, 207 succeeded in clearing the town without a single civilian casualty, demonstrating their unwavering commitment to protecting innocent lives.

Simultaneously, a coordinated airborne and mechanized assault on the town of Gorqan proved instrumental in further weakening Ion Corp's hold on the region. While facing heavy resistance, 207 units managed to disrupt enemy reinforcements and secure vital objectives. Despite the loss of local police forces to Ion Corp's aggression, 207 forces remained resolute, eliminating the enemy garrison and thwarting their nefarious plans.

As the dust settled, 207 forces uncovered a disturbing revelationâ€”an underground cache of ammunition being clandestinely emptied by Ion Corp troops. Undeterred by this discovery, 207 pressed forward with a multipronged assault on the dig site and storage facility, overcoming Ion Corp's desperate attempts at reinforcement by air. The successful recovery of all four containment devices marked a significant victory for 207, leading to speculation about the true intentions of Ion Corp and the origins of these mysterious devices. With these questions lingering in the air, 207 remains steadfast in its pursuit of justice and liberation in the face of adversity.
