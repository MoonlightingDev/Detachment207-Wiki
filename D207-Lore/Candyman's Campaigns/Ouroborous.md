Welcome to Virolahti, a fictional coastal region located in Bulgaria. This area has fallen into turmoil as Turkish forces, equipped with surplus U.S. military hardware, have invaded and begun enforcing the will of a dangerous dictatorship. Your mission as part of 207 is to bring this crisis to a decisive end and restore order to the region, while rescuing key government officials who have gone into hiding.

**Key Campaign Objectives:**
Recover Democratic Government Members in Hiding: The legitimate democratic government has been driven underground, hiding from the Turkish-backed dictatorship. Your primary mission is to locate these individuals, secure their safety, and reinstate proper governance in the region.

**Destroy Naval Bases and Assets:** 
Turkish forces have established several naval bases along the Virolahti coast, from which they are harassing ships in the Bosphorus Strait. These naval operations are disrupting international shipping routes and enabling the dictator’s forces to maintain control. We must eliminate all naval assets in the region to open the Strait and cripple their coastal defences.

**Eliminate Key Military Infrastructure: 
To gain control over the region, you will be tasked with identifying and destroying several critical assets, including bases, checkpoints, and communication hubs. Each of these locations has been carefully fortified, and control over them will allow us to cut off Turkish reinforcements and supplies.

**Locate and Neutralize the Dictator: **
Intelligence suggests that the dictator is using the chaos as cover to consolidate power. Your ultimate goal is to find their location and ensure that they are eliminated before they can escape the region and destabilize neighbouring areas.

**Break the Grip of the Turkish Military Occupation:** 
Turkish forces have begun installing their own police forces, replacing local law enforcement and using these proxy units to control the population. They are forcing the people of Virolahti into submission, coercing them to support the dictator's rule. These forces must be rooted out and eliminated to free the local population and restore order.

**The Terrain and Challenges:**
Virolahti’s landscape presents numerous challenges, with wide-open fields allowing enemy forces clear lines of sight. Turkish forces are well-equipped and entrenched, utilizing advanced weaponry and surplus equipment, including heavily fortified naval positions and entrenched military outposts.

The enemy has installed formidable defences, including minefields, bunkers, and roadblocks across critical choke points. Expect fierce resistance as they desperately try to maintain their hold on the region.



**Submarine Bases Neutralized:**
207 has successfully eliminated the sub bases along the western coasts, effectively cutting the enemy's naval strength in half. However, a second sub base remains operational, posing a continued threat to the Bosphorus Strait and the region's coastal defenses. This will be a future target as we continue pushing the enemy back.

**Devastation in Regions Alpha and Bravo:**
Key military infrastructure in Region Alpha and Region Bravo has been devastated by 207. Ammo depots have been wiped out, leaving the enemy forces severely depleted of high-caliber ammunition. Rocket supplies have also run critically low, causing the enemy to withdraw eastward while leaving behind only light garrisoning forces to slow our advances. This withdrawal presents us with an opportunity to advance more aggressively as enemy forces scramble to regroup.

**Artillery Base Destroyed:**
The enemy artillery base has been obliterated by 207's precision strikes, significantly reducing their indirect fire capabilities. With artillery support crippled, the enemy is forced to rely heavily on their air assets to maintain pressure. This shift is advantageous, as we can expect lighter resistance on the ground but should remain vigilant for air strikes and drone reconnaissance.

**Mission Outlook
Local Intel and Presidential Hiding Spot:**
Thanks to our success in liberating local civilians and winning their support, we've received crucial information: the President and his cabinet are in hiding nearby. This represents a significant opportunity for 207. Securing the President and his government is now a top priority in the upcoming mission, and we must act quickly before the enemy discovers their location.

**Turkish Forces in Retreat:**
The Turkish forces, equipped with US surplus gear, have suffered devastating losses at the hands of 207. With their night-vision-equipped armor reduced to rubble, the tide is turning. During the day, 207 has repelled multiple attacks, forcing a stalemate. As night falls, with the enemy's technological advantage weakened, 207 is going on the prowl under the cover of darkness. It’s time to capitalize on their disarray and drive deeper into enemy territory.

--------------------------------------

The 207th has struck critical blows against the dictator’s grip in Virolahti, dismantling key naval and communication assets that once secured his dominance. In a series of daring and costly operations, our forces targeted and neutralized the infamous Grey Wolves hunt packs at three discovered submarine bases. With these elite submarine forces scuttled, the dictator’s capacity for swift, covert naval action has been severely diminished. Perhaps the most decisive blow was delivered during the assault on the dictator’s prized frigate, the Hand of God. In an intense battle that saw heavy resistance and losses, the frigate was finally destroyed, leaving a massive gap in the dictator’s coastal defense and offensive capabilities. The loss of this flagship has left his forces vulnerable, depriving them of a powerful asset that once provided a formidable shield against our advances.

Additionally, 207 executed a successful mission to destroy the enemy’s over-the-horizon radar and primary communications station, effectively blinding, deafening, and disorienting the Turkish-backed forces. Deprived of reliable intelligence and coordination, these forces were forced to retreat toward the capital, leaving the region’s outer defenses in disarray. Through hard-fought battles, 207 managed to capture two high-ranking submarine captains. These captives, in exchange for pardons and asylum, provided valuable intelligence on the positions of enemy submarines and naval units harassing the Bosphorus Strait. NATO allies, armed with this information, launched devastating strikes, sweeping the strait of hostile forces and reopening the shipping lanes that are vital to the region’s stability. The 207th also secured critical cipher keys from the communications station. With these keys, our intelligence teams are now able to decode enemy transmissions, giving us a potential edge in anticipating Turkish-backed forces' strategies and movements. As we prepare for the final stages of this campaign, our combined victories have drastically weakened the dictator’s hold on Virolahti and pushed his forces to the brink. The liberation of Virolahti is within reach.
