D207's 2am Operation was largely successful. 
1) Largely successful raid to secure 35 civilians from the hostage base. 
2) Reclaiming stolen supplies/kidnapped C-130 pilots and staff. 
3) Assault and subsequent destruction of an indirect fire base. 
4) Leveling an old US captured/repurposed FARP with an accurate 155mm artillery barrage from 15 kilometers away. 
5) Clearance of a fortified town. 
6) Repelling of heavy contact and inflicting massive losses whilst sustaining virtually 0 in reply. 


All in a 3 hour period... 
There was some hiccups with the civilian extraction, but D207 rolled with the punch's and come out on top. It gave The Salafi Dawn a real demonstration of D207s capabilities. The Salafi Dawn is still reeling from these blows, and its broken the resolve of some of the fighters - predominately the newer converts. The veterans members aren't phased at all - its nothing new to them and they outlasted the Soviets, and the Western forces, twice. 

So dont expect them to roll over and give up. Their leaders are preaching to push on against the inferior Westerners.
