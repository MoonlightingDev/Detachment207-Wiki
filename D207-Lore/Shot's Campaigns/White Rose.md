**A Shift in Roles – 207 as Defenders** 
Following the highly successful joint training exercise between 207 and the Spanish Forces, the battlefield dynamic has shifted dramatically. During the exercise, 207 demonstrated their mastery of combined air tactics and infantry-based manoeuvres, overwhelming the Spanish defenders and showcasing their ability to operate with precision and adaptability. However, the Spanish forces have taken the lessons learned to heart and are now applying this knowledge to their offensive doctrine. As a result, the tables have turned—207 now takes on the role of defenders, tasked with holding their ground against a highly motivated and evolving adversary. The Spanish forces, emboldened by their new strategies, are preparing to launch an offensive that combines aggressive multi-dimensional warfare and meticulous planning. Determined to replicate the success they witnessed from 207, the Spanish have committed to fully mobilizing their resources and tactics, making this new phase of the campaign a gruelling test of 207's defensive capabilities.


**Spanish Offensive Strategy Combined Arms Assault:** 
Spanish forces will deploy infantry, armor, and air support in concert, using the synergy they observed from 207’s previous operations. Rotary-wing assets and fixed-wing air support will provide rapid troop deployments, close air support, and reconnaissance to keep the pressure on defensive positions. 


**Field Engineering & Offensive FOBs**:
Spanish Foxtrot units are tasked with rapidly establishing Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) near key choke points and defensive positions, enabling sustained pressure on 207. Mortar teams will be deployed alongside these FOBs, providing indirect fire support to soften defensive positions and force 207 to react under fire. 


**Logistical Overwatch:** 
Fully utilizing their logistical assets, the Spanish will maintain a steady flow of reinforcements and supplies to keep their assault relentless. Mobile repair and resupply units will ensure their armored vehicles and artillery remain operational during extended engagements.

The coming battles will test the mettle of both forces. For the Spanish, this is their opportunity to prove that they can take the lessons learned from 207 and turn them into a winning strategy. For 207, this is a chance to demonstrate their resilience, adaptability, and ability to hold their ground under overwhelming pressure. As the Spanish forces begin their assault, the battlefield will be transformed into a deadly chessboard where every decision counts. The outcome of this campaign will not only determine the fate of the region but also prove whether 207’s training can withstand the test of its own teaching. The defenders must prepare for an unrelenting assault, for the Spanish forces are coming with everything they have learned—and more.
