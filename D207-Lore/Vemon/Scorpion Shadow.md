In response to the escalating threat posed by Asad Bitar, also known as "The Scorpion" NATO forces have deployed 207 to North Takistan to reinforce US troops who are currently overwhelmed and suffering significant casualties. Our mission is to locate and neutralise The Scorpion and dismantle his terrorist organisation.

**Background**

The Scorpion is responsible for hundreds of bombings and the manufacture of IEDs, causing widespread destruction and fear. His influence has expanded globally, with recent attacks reported in Turkey, Spain, Germany, and even Australia. Intelligence has traced The Scorpion to North Takistan, where he operates covertly with significant support from an unknown number of followers.

**Situation**

Over the past three years The Scorpion has established multiple factories producing highly transportable and difficult-to-defuse explosives. The exact number of his followers remains unknown, but his organisation is receiving significant support from OPFOR forces. In exchange for their aid, OPFOR is gaining access to natural resources from all of Takistan.

Currently, a truce exists between NATO and OPFOR, but the situation is highly volatile and could escalate at any moment.


----------

The dire situation spreading across North Takistan has been abruptly halted by the swift and decisive actions of Detachment 207. Tasked with securing the town of Tazri and investigating rumours of enemy occupation at the Hajigak mine, the detachment not only achieved these objectives but also dealt a significant blow to the Scorpion Shadow insurgency. They successfully liberated two towns and dismantled one of the Scorpion Shadow's critical IED factories, showcasing NATO's continued strength and resolve.

However, the Scorpion Shadow group is exploiting civilian casualties to bolster their propaganda and recruit sympathisers, using their distinctive scorpion and star flags to rally support. NATO remains committed to reducing their influence and maintaining stability in the region. With this operation, Detachment 207 has affirmed that NATO remains a formidable force, ready to counter any threat to peace and security.

The Battle of Kushkak and Yakavlang is a tale no one will forget. Returning soldiers compared it to Armageddon or even the fiery depths of the underworld, with burning cities and large smoke clouds. While some, bearing scars that will haunt them for life, likened it to a beautiful picnic on a sunny spring day. One thing remains certain: many dog tags were retrieved. Even though 207 were victorious on this day, there are wounds that cannot heal.

**Reputation:**
There were many civilian casualties reported; some locals sadly witnessed their precious religious monuments being bombarded from the sky. But their homes, markets, and hospitals were liberated and returned to them thanks to NATO forces.

The 207 Press team has flooded the local media with images depicting the true nature of the Scorpion Shadow and RU occupation. While this alone was not enough to improve NATO relations with the civilians, there have been several accounts of locals praising 207 for their efforts.

One man from the town of Laura said (translated from Takistani): "Fearless heroes! Risked their lives to rid my home of these death bombs. My children can play on the streets again."

**Result:**
Many leads have come forth to reveal critical information regarding RU and Scorpion Shadow movements. The majority are on the retreat. Whilst US forces have gained traction in the state. Further information is redacted and will be provided in your mission briefs. However, one thing is certain: the Scorpion will fall.

---------------

The NATO campaign in North Takistan has concluded with resounding success. The High-Value Target (HVT), Asad Bitar, known as "The Scorpion," has been eliminated, and his terrorist organisation, The Scorpion's Shadow, has been dismantled. Through the dedicated efforts of Detachment 207, peace and stability have been restored to the region.

The elimination of The Scorpion and the dismantling of his network have significantly improved life in North Takistan. The daily threat of bombings and IEDs has been drastically reduced, allowing normalcy to return to local communities. Key towns have been liberated, critical infrastructure has been secured, and the presence of NATO and US forces has ensured ongoing security.

In the wake of the successful operations, humanitarian organisations are now entering the state to aid in the recovery process. These organisations are playing a crucial role in clearing the remaining IEDs, ensuring the safety of civilians and paving the way for reconstruction efforts. They are also working to rebuild critical infrastructure that was lost or damaged during the conflict, including schools, hospitals, and religious sites.

Civilians can now move freely without fear, and local governance is being restored with the help of NATO forces. The efforts to clear IEDs and rebuild infrastructure are not only restoring safety and functionality to the region but also providing hope for a brighter, safer future for its inhabitants.

The success of this campaign underscores NATO's commitment to global peace and security. Detachment 207's bravery, precision, and unwavering dedication were instrumental in achieving these objectives. This operation serves as a testament to the effectiveness of international cooperation in combating terrorism and restoring stability in conflict-affected regions.

**Mission Successful.**
